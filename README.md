### Task Management App Part 1 - Spring Boot

In this repository, we focus on backend operations such as adding, updating, and deleting tasks. The backend is built using:

Spring Boot: For creating a robust and scalable backend.

Hibernate: For object-relational mapping and database interaction.

SQL: For managing and querying the task database.

We also use Postman to test and verify API endpoints for seamless task management

This part handles all server-side logic and interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations effectively.
